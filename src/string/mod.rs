///
/// Simple wrapper around String to read and write various layouts.
/// This looks as a simple wrapper over String, `StringDeku` structure is built
/// to be able of reading and writing of various common binary layouts.
///
/// For example,
///
/// * Fixed Length Layout represents a fixed amount of elements (bytes or words depending on encoding)
///   to read and write
/// * Length prefixed layout represent Pascal-like strings
/// * Zero ended — C-like strings.
///
/// How it's different from using Deku directly?
///
/// * It's convenient way to create and maintain models:
///    * no readers and writers,
///    * no running `update` function, which may be forgotten
/// * `StringDeku` implementation checks if there was no unexpected zero characters in the middle,
///   which could be missed during decoding, resulting in a probably dangerous values.
///
/// While content is hidden, `to_string`, `into` and equality functions and operators provide
/// convenient way to make operations easier.
